# This file is interpreted in perl, so it is case sensitive

# Use of any variables other than those already in this

# ------------------------------- Paper Attributes
$normalpaper = 11 		# Use your printer's page size here
$normalwidth = 8.5      # Printer's page width.
$ewidth = 9.5           # Envelope Width
$eheight = 4.125        # Envelope Height



# ------------------------------- Margins
# For printers that center the envelope on the feeder or put it all the way
# to the right, you will need to make the top margin larger.   
# The $feedleft, $feedcenter, and $feedright variables should take care of
# this.  Just add the proper one to $topmargin.
$feedleft = 0
$feedright = $normalwidth - $eheight 
$feedcenter = $normalwidth/2 - $eheight/2

$leftmargin = 0.25
$topmargin = 0.30 + $feedcenter



# ------------------------------- General Settings
$shiplabel = 0  # print labels in a single column for easy shipping labels
$barcode = 1    # include POSTNET barcode for Zip or Zip+4?
$bcaddressblock = 0 # put the POSTNET code with the address block?  If false,
					# then the barcode will go to the standard bottom-right 
                    # side of the envelope, otherwise it will be the last line
                    # of the address block.
$fromfile = ""  # file to load default return address from



# ------------------------------- Default Label Attributes
$line1 = "Times-Roman-Bold 12"  # Label font attributes, first line

# ------------------------------- Default Return Address Attributes
