Installation:

1) tar -zxvf envelope.tgz
2) copy /envelope/samplerc to ~/.enveloperc and edit it to suit your needs
3) copy envelope program to someplace in your path, if you like


This program does work under Microsoft Windows (I tested with activestate perl)
The only requirement is that you create a home environment variable, and put 
.enveloperc in that directory.  For example:

	copy c:\downloads\envelope\samplerc c:\home\.enveloperc
	set home=c:\home
	perl envelope address > output.txt
	print output.txt
