[options]
# This is an example of the simplest address file you can use.  Notice you do
# not need the "[to]" section so long as the address is the first block in the
# file.  

# This file also contains a delivery point code, so the entire POSTNET
# barcode will be generated for this address.  

# If you have a $fromfile
# specified, your return address will come from that file for this address,
# otherwise the return address will be blank.

# If you have a $fromfile defined in your .enveloperc but want to override it,
# use [from] in the address.  Yes, you can use a blank [from] section.

# As you can see in this example, the [options] section is a good place for
# comments.
